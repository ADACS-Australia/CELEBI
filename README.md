# CELEBI: The CRAFT Effortless Localisation and Enhanced Burst Inspection Pipeline

CELEBI (arxiv pending) is an automated data processing pipeline for producing sub-arcsecond precision localisations and high-time resolution polarimetric measurements of fast radio bursts (FRBs) from voltages obtained with the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP).
